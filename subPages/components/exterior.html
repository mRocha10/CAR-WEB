            <h2>Exterior & Chassis Components</h2>
            <h3>The Foundation of Modern Vehicles</h3>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Body Structure & Materials</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Modern vehicle bodies use high-strength steel for structural integrity, aluminum alloys for lightweight durability, and carbon fiber composites in premium models. Magnesium alloys further contribute to weight reduction while maintaining strength.</p>
                <p>Manufacturing processes like hydroforming allow complex shapes, while hot stamping enhances ultra-high-strength components. Laser welding ensures precise joints, and advanced adhesives enable multi-material bonding for enhanced performance.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Suspension Systems</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Modern suspension systems integrate adaptive damping, air suspension, and electronic stability control to optimize comfort and handling. Active anti-roll bars and predictive damping, which scans the road ahead, ensure a smoother and safer driving experience.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Aerodynamics & Exterior Design</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Advanced aerodynamics play a key role in efficiency and stability. Features like active grille shutters, underbody panels, rear diffusers, and integrated spoilers manage airflow for improved fuel economy and performance.</p>
                <p>Modern lighting systems include LED matrix headlights with adaptive beams, dynamic turn signals, and automatic high beam control. Integrated ambient lighting further enhances the vehicle's exterior aesthetics and functionality.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Glass & Visibility Systems</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Automotive glass has evolved to include acoustic laminated windshields for noise reduction, UV-protective coatings, and heated surfaces for defrosting. Electrochromic glass automatically dims to reduce glare.</p>
                <p>Smart visibility systems enhance safety with rain-sensing wipers, integrated antenna systems, 360-degree cameras, and head-up displays projected onto the windshield for driver convenience.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Exterior Accessories & Protection</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Modern vehicles come with power-folding heated mirrors, hands-free power liftgates, and running boards with LED lighting. Roof rails with integrated crossbars provide additional functionality for outdoor enthusiasts.</p>
                <p>Protective features like ceramic coatings, paint protection films, anti-chip body cladding, and integrated parking sensors help maintain the vehicle's exterior and ensure long-term durability.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Braking Systems</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Braking systems in modern vehicles include anti-lock braking to prevent wheel lock-up, electronic brake-force distribution for optimal stopping power, and regenerative braking in hybrids and electric cars to improve efficiency. Advanced systems also incorporate automatic emergency braking and hill-start assist.</p>
            </article>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Wheels & Tires</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Wheels and tires are engineered for both performance and fuel efficiency. Low rolling resistance tires improve mileage while maintaining grip. Run-flat technology allows vehicles to travel even after a puncture. Tire pressure monitoring systems help maintain optimal inflation, while advanced wheel designs focus on aerodynamics and weight reduction.</p>
