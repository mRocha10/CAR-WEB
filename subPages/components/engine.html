                <h4>Engine Block & Cylinder Head</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>The engine block, often called the cylinder block, is the foundation of an internal combustion engine. It houses the cylinders and their components. Modern blocks are typically made from cast iron or aluminum alloys for optimal strength and heat dissipation. The cylinder head, mounted on top of the block, contains the combustion chambers, valves, and passages for the fuel-air mixture and exhaust gases.</p>

                <h4>Pistons & Connecting Rods</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Pistons are crucial components that move up and down within the cylinders, converting the force from combustion into mechanical energy. Modern pistons are engineered with advanced alloys and coatings to reduce friction and withstand high temperatures. The connecting rods link the pistons to the crankshaft, transferring the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion.</p>

                <h4>Fuel Injection Systems</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Modern engines use sophisticated fuel injection systems that precisely control fuel delivery. Direct injection systems spray fuel directly into the combustion chamber, while port injection delivers fuel to the intake port. Electronic control units constantly adjust injection timing and duration based on various sensor inputs to optimize performance and efficiency.</p>

                <h4>Turbochargers & Superchargers</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Forced induction systems like turbochargers and superchargers increase engine power by compressing the incoming air, allowing more fuel to be burned. Turbochargers use exhaust gases to spin a turbine, while superchargers are mechanically driven. Modern systems often feature variable geometry technology to optimize performance across the entire RPM range.</p>

                <h4>Engine Management Systems</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Modern engines rely on sophisticated electronic control units (ECUs) that monitor and adjust various parameters in real-time. These systems manage everything from fuel injection and ignition timing to valve timing and emissions control. Advanced features like cylinder deactivation and start-stop technology help improve efficiency without sacrificing performance.</p>
