            <h2>Engine Components</h2>
            <h3>The Power Behind Modern Vehicles</h3>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Engine Block & Cylinder Head</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>The engine block forms the backbone of an internal combustion engine, housing the cylinders, coolant passages, and oil galleries. It is typically made from cast iron or aluminum alloy to provide strength while managing heat efficiently. Some high-performance engines feature reinforced blocks with precision CNC machining for durability under extreme stress.</p>
                <p>The cylinder head sits atop the engine block, sealing the combustion chambers and allowing the air-fuel mixture to enter while exhaust gases exit. Modern cylinder heads include multi-valve configurations, which allow better airflow and more efficient combustion. They may also feature variable valve timing systems, helping optimize performance at different RPMs.</p>
                <p>Many high-performance engines utilize dual overhead camshafts (DOHC) for precise control over valve operation. Additionally, advanced materials like titanium and magnesium are sometimes used to reduce weight and improve efficiency.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Pistons & Connecting Rods</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Pistons play a critical role in transferring the force from combustion into motion. They are usually made from high-strength aluminum alloys, which provide a good balance of lightweight construction and durability. Advanced coatings, such as thermal barrier and graphite-based coatings, help improve efficiency by reducing heat absorption and friction.</p>
                <p>Each piston is connected to the crankshaft via a connecting rod. These rods are often forged from steel or titanium for added strength, as they endure high levels of stress during operation. Modern connecting rods may feature a fracture-split design, ensuring perfect cap alignment for better longevity.</p>
                <p>Many high-performance engines utilize lightweight, high-compression pistons that improve combustion efficiency, providing more power without increasing fuel consumption significantly.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Crankshaft & Camshaft</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>The crankshaft is responsible for converting the linear motion of the pistons into rotational motion, driving the powertrain. It is usually made from forged steel or billet steel for maximum strength. Some high-performance engines incorporate counterweights and dampers to reduce vibrations and enhance smooth operation.</p>
                <p>The camshaft controls valve timing, ensuring the proper opening and closing of intake and exhaust valves. Many modern engines feature variable valve timing (VVT), adjusting valve operation based on engine speed and load. Some performance-oriented engines even employ camless designs, using electromagnetic actuators for precise valve control.</p>
                <p>Recent developments include hollow camshafts to reduce weight and friction coatings that help extend component lifespan. The timing mechanism connecting the crankshaft to the camshaft often consists of durable timing chains or reinforced belts with hydraulic tensioners for smooth operation.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Fuel Injection System</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Fuel injection systems deliver fuel into the combustion chamber with precision, improving efficiency and reducing emissions. Direct fuel injection systems spray fuel directly into the cylinders at high pressures, typically up to 350 bar. Some engines also use a combination of port and direct injection for optimal performance.</p>
                <p>Modern fuel injectors utilize piezoelectric technology, allowing multiple injections per combustion cycle. These systems enhance fuel atomization, improving combustion efficiency. Electronic control units (ECUs) constantly monitor fuel delivery, making real-time adjustments based on engine load and driving conditions.</p>
                <p>Advanced fuel systems also integrate with cylinder deactivation technology, allowing some cylinders to shut down under light loads, improving fuel efficiency.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Turbochargers & Superchargers</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Turbochargers and superchargers are used to increase engine power by forcing more air into the cylinders. Turbochargers use exhaust gases to spin a turbine, while superchargers are mechanically driven by the engine. This additional airflow allows for more fuel to be burned, generating greater power.</p>
                <p>Modern turbochargers incorporate variable geometry technology, adjusting airflow dynamically for better performance across the RPM range. Some high-performance applications use twin-scroll turbochargers, reducing turbo lag and improving throttle response.</p>
                <p>Electric turbochargers are emerging in hybrid and high-performance vehicles, providing instant boost without the typical delay found in conventional turbo systems.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Cooling & Lubrication Systems</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Cooling systems regulate engine temperature using radiators, water pumps, and thermostats. Many modern engines use electric water pumps, allowing precise temperature control without drawing excessive power. Some designs feature active thermal management, optimizing heat distribution for efficiency.</p>
                <p>Lubrication plays a crucial role in minimizing wear between moving parts. High-performance synthetic oils enhance durability and maintain viscosity under extreme conditions. Variable-flow oil pumps adjust lubrication based on engine demand, reducing power loss and improving efficiency.</p>
                <p>Some engines incorporate oil coolers and dry sump lubrication systems, which prevent oil starvation during aggressive driving or racing conditions.</p>

            <article class="component-section">
                <h4>Ignition System</h4>
                <div class="component-image-placeholder"></div>
                <p>Modern ignition systems use coil-on-plug technology, eliminating traditional spark plug wires for a more direct spark. High-energy ignition coils ensure complete combustion, while advanced spark plugs with iridium or platinum tips offer superior durability and conductivity.</p>
                <p>Electronic ignition timing optimizes spark delivery, improving fuel economy and reducing emissions. Knock sensors detect pre-ignition and adjust timing accordingly, preventing engine damage.</p>
