                        <p class="info-text">Modern sedans are engineered with a focus on aerodynamic efficiency, resulting in superior fuel economy and refined handling characteristics. The three-box design, featuring separate compartments for engine, passengers, and cargo, provides optimal weight distribution and structural integrity. Advanced aerodynamics include features like active grille shutters, underbody panels, and integrated rear spoilers that enhance both efficiency and stability. The latest powertrain technologies incorporate hybrid and plug-in hybrid systems, turbocharged engines with direct injection, and advanced transmission systems featuring up to 10 speeds for optimal performance and efficiency.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">State-of-the-art safety features include adaptive cruise control, lane departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, and autonomous emergency braking. Advanced driver assistance systems (ADAS) now incorporate AI-powered predictive safety features, 360-degree camera systems with augmented reality displays, and night vision capabilities. The sophisticated suspension systems often feature adaptive damping, electronic stability control, and dynamic torque vectoring for enhanced handling precision. Interior technology integration brings wireless smartphone connectivity, digital instrument clusters, heads-up displays with augmented reality navigation, premium sound systems with active noise cancellation, and over-the-air software updates for continuous feature enhancement.</p>
