                <p class="info-text">Sedans represent the quintessential family vehicle, combining practicality, comfort, and efficiency in a traditional four-door configuration with a separate trunk compartment. Distinguished by their three-box design—separate engine compartment, passenger cabin, and cargo area—sedans offer excellent structural rigidity, quiet cabins isolated from road noise, and versatile passenger accommodation. Available in compact (160-180 inches long), mid-size (190-200 inches), and full-size (200+ inches) variants, sedans serve diverse needs from efficient urban commuters to luxurious executive transports. Modern sedans feature sophisticated platforms delivering car-like handling dynamics superior to taller SUVs, with lower centers of gravity enhancing cornering stability and responsive steering. Fuel economy advantages remain significant—compact sedans achieve 30-40 MPG combined, mid-size models deliver 25-35 MPG, while full-size sedans manage 20-28 MPG, all surpassing comparable SUVs by 3-8 MPG.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text">The sedan format prioritizes passenger comfort through spacious cabins accommodating five adults with genuine rear-seat legroom (35-40 inches in mid-size/full-size models versus 30-35 inches in compact sedans). Three-across rear seating remains feasible for short trips, aided by flat rear floors maximizing comfort. Trunk capacities range 12-16 cubic feet (compact), 15-18 cubic feet (mid-size), and 16-20+ cubic feet (full-size), providing secure, climate-controlled cargo space protected from weather and theft. Sedan trunks easily accommodate golf clubs, luggage for family vacations, or weekly grocery runs, with many models featuring 60/40 split-folding rear seats extending cargo capacity for longer items. The separate trunk design offers security advantages—contents remain hidden from casual observation—and maintains cabin temperature by isolating cargo from passenger space.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text">Safety credentials distinguish modern sedans, with most models achieving Top Safety Pick+ ratings from IIHS and 5-star NHTSA crash test scores. Lower ride heights compared to SUVs reduce rollover risks, while advanced high-strength steel construction (up to 60-70% of body structure) and strategic crumple zones optimize crash energy management. Comprehensive airbag systems (front, side, curtain, sometimes knee airbags) protect occupants in multiple collision scenarios. Standard or available driver assistance technologies include automatic emergency braking with pedestrian detection, blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, lane keeping assist, and adaptive cruise control. Premium sedans add features like night vision systems, surround-view cameras, and semi-autonomous driving capabilities.

                <p class="info-text"><strong>Safety Technologies:</strong> Modern sedans incorporate comprehensive active safety systems preventing or mitigating collisions. Forward collision warning with automatic emergency braking uses radar and camera systems detecting vehicles, pedestrians, or cyclists, applying maximum braking force if driver fails to respond. Lane departure warning and lane keeping assist use cameras reading road markings, providing steering corrections maintaining lane position. Blind spot monitoring systems use radar sensors detecting vehicles in adjacent lanes, illuminating warning indicators in side mirrors and providing steering resistance if turn signals activate with vehicles present. Adaptive cruise control maintains set following distances, adjusting speed automatically in traffic and bringing vehicles to complete stops in congested conditions (with some systems requiring driver input to resume). Rear cross traffic alert warns of approaching vehicles when reversing from parking spaces. Premium sedans add advanced features like night vision systems highlighting pedestrians/animals in darkness, heads-up displays projecting speed and navigation information onto windshields, and 360-degree camera systems providing bird's-eye vehicle views during parking.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text"><strong>Efficiency & Environmental Impact:</strong> Sedans lead fuel economy among traditional vehicle types through aerodynamic profiles and optimized powertrains. Drag coefficients of 0.26-0.30 (compared to 0.32-0.38 for SUVs) reduce wind resistance, directly improving highway efficiency. Engine technologies including direct fuel injection, variable valve timing, cylinder deactivation (V6/V8 engines), and turbocharging extract maximum energy from fuel. Hybrid sedans like Toyota Camry Hybrid, Honda Accord Hybrid, and Hyundai Sonata Hybrid achieve 45-55 MPG combined, reducing fuel costs $500-800 annually versus non-hybrid equivalents. Plug-in hybrid sedans (Hyundai Ioniq PHEV, Honda Clarity) offer 20-30 miles electric-only range for daily commuting while maintaining gasoline backup for longer trips. Lower curb weights compared to SUVs (compact sedans 2,800-3,200 lbs, mid-size 3,200-3,700 lbs, full-size 3,700-4,300 lbs versus SUVs adding 300-800 lbs) require less energy for acceleration. Start-stop systems automatically shut off engines at traffic lights, saving fuel during urban driving. Eco driving modes optimize throttle response and transmission shift points maximizing economy.</p>
