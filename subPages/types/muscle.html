                        <p class="info-text">Muscle cars are defined by their large-displacement engines, typically V8s, delivering impressive horsepower and torque. Their aggressive styling includes wide bodies, bold grilles, and distinctive hood scoops, all designed to emphasize their performance-oriented nature. The sound of a muscle car's engine is as much a part of its character as its visual appearance.</p>
