            <div class="info-content">
                <p class="info-text">Muscle cars represent the zenith of American automotive power and performance heritage, embodying the philosophy that "there's no replacement for displacement." These iconic vehicles feature large-displacement V8 engines ranging from 5.0L to 7.0L+, producing 400-800+ horsepower and equally impressive torque figures of 400-700+ lb-ft. Born in the 1960s golden era with legendary models like the Pontiac GTO, Chevrolet Chevelle SS, and Plymouth Road Runner, muscle cars prioritize straight-line acceleration and raw power over sophisticated handling dynamics. Modern interpretations like the Dodge Challenger Hellcat, Chevrolet Camaro ZL1, and Ford Mustang GT500 continue this tradition while incorporating contemporary technology, achieving 0-60 mph times of 3.3-4.5 seconds and quarter-mile runs in 10.5-12 seconds.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text">The muscle car formula centers on affordable performance: large, powerful engines in mid-size to full-size two-door coupes with rear-wheel drive. Unlike exotic sports cars emphasizing lightweight construction and precision handling, muscle cars deliver accessible horsepower through proven pushrod V8 architectures (particularly in American brands) or overhead cam designs. Curb weights typically range 3,500-4,300 lbs, with performance achieved through sheer power rather than weight reduction. Pricing accessibility defines the segment—$35,000-$80,000 for most models—making serious performance attainable for enthusiasts without supercar budgets. This democratization of power distinguishes muscle cars from European performance vehicles costing 2-3 times more.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text">Modern muscle cars blend classic styling cues—long hoods, short rear decks, aggressive stances, and retro-inspired design elements—with contemporary performance technology. Adaptive suspension systems transform vehicles from comfortable daily drivers to track-capable performers at the touch of a button. Launch control systems optimize acceleration from standstill, managing wheel slip and power delivery for consistent launches. Advanced traction and stability control systems (often fully defeatable for experienced drivers) tame the substantial power, while Brembo brake systems with 6-piston calipers and 15+ inch rotors provide stopping power matching acceleration capability. Despite their performance focus, modern muscle cars offer daily usability with comfortable interiors, advanced infotainment (8-12 inch touchscreens), and driver assistance features.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text">The visceral driving experience defines muscle car appeal: thunderous exhaust notes (often enhanced through active exhaust systems with adjustable modes), immediate throttle response delivering tire-shredding acceleration, and the mechanical drama of supercharger whine or naturally aspirated V8 crescendos approaching 7,000+ RPM redlines. Fuel economy remains secondary—expect 13-18 MPG combined in spirited driving, improving to 20-25 MPG on highways when cruising gently. The muscle car community celebrates drag racing heritage, with many owners participating in test-and-tune nights at local dragstrips, pursuing ever-quicker elapsed times through modifications and driver skill development. These vehicles represent rolling American automotive history, connecting modern enthusiasts to the golden era of Detroit performance while offering contemporary reliability and technology.</p>

                <h3 class="info-title">Distinctive Features</h3>
            </header>
            <div class="info-content">
                <p class="info-text"><strong>V8 Engine Technology:</strong> Modern muscle car engines represent the pinnacle of internal combustion development. Naturally aspirated variants (Ford Mustang GT 5.0L Coyote, Chevrolet Camaro LT1 6.2L) utilize dual overhead cams with variable valve timing, direct fuel injection at 2,900 PSI, and sophisticated engine management producing 450-480 hp at 6,500-7,000 RPM. Pushrod V8s (Chevrolet LT4/LT5) achieve similar outputs through simpler, more compact designs with lower centers of gravity. Supercharged variants (Dodge Challenger/Charger Hellcat, Shelby GT500) add 2.7L-2.9L superchargers producing 11-14 PSI boost, resulting in 650-807 hp and similar torque figures. These forced-induction engines feature reinforced blocks, forged internals (pistons, connecting rods, crankshafts), and upgraded cooling systems handling extreme thermal loads. Fuel systems deliver massive flow rates (850+ cc injectors, high-volume pumps) supporting power outputs unimaginable decades ago.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text"><strong>Transmissions & Drivetrain:</strong> Muscle cars offer enthusiasts transmission choices: 6-speed manual transmissions with short-throw shifters, rev-matching functions (automatically blipping throttle during downshifts), and heavy-duty clutches handling 650+ lb-ft torque. Many enthusiasts prefer manuals for maximum engagement despite slower acceleration than automatics. Modern 8-10 speed automatic transmissions with multiple performance modes shift in 80-100 milliseconds, utilizing paddle shifters for manual control when desired. Launch control systems available on automatics optimize clutch slip and power delivery, enabling consistent 0-60 mph runs within 0.1 seconds. Rear-wheel drive platforms feature limited-slip differentials or electronic locking differentials managing wheel slip during hard acceleration. Driveshafts utilize carbon fiber in high-performance variants, reducing rotational mass while handling extreme torque.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text"><strong>Suspension & Handling:</strong> Modern muscle cars employ sophisticated suspension systems transforming handling from their 1960s ancestors. Independent rear suspension (IRS) replaces solid rear axles in most applications, improving ride quality and handling dynamics through better wheel control. Magnetic Ride Control adaptive dampers (on GM products) adjust damping rates 1,000 times per second, providing compliant rides in Tour mode while firming dramatically in Track mode. Multilink front and rear suspension geometries maximize tire contact patches during cornering, with spring rates tuned for performance (300-500 lb/in versus 200-300 in passenger cars). Adjustable stabilizer bars reduce body roll while maintaining compliance over uneven surfaces. Track-focused variants feature adjustable suspension allowing corner weight, ride height, and damping tuning. Wide tires (275-305mm front, 305-325mm rear) provide massive grip, generating lateral accelerations approaching 1.0g.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text"><strong>Brakes & Safety Systems:</strong> Stopping 4,000+ lb vehicles traveling 150+ mph requires substantial braking systems. Brembo high-performance brakes are standard or optional on most muscle cars, featuring 6-piston front calipers (15.0-16.1 inch rotors) and 4-piston rear calipers (14.0-15.4 inch rotors). Two-piece or carbon ceramic rotors (on extreme variants) resist fade during repeated high-speed braking. Brake cooling ducts channel air to rotors during track use. Electronic stability control and traction control systems utilize sophisticated algorithms managing power delivery to individual wheels, though performance-oriented drivers often disable these for maximum control. Modern muscle cars achieve excellent safety ratings through reinforced structures, comprehensive airbag systems (front, side, curtain), and available driver assistance features including blind spot monitoring, rear cross traffic alert, and adaptive cruise control.</p>
                
                <p class="info-text"><strong>Styling & Aerodynamics:</strong> Muscle car design celebrates aggressive masculinity through long hoods suggesting engine power beneath, short rear decks emphasizing cab-rearward proportions, and wide stances communicating stability. Functional aerodynamic elements include hood scoops (providing cold air to engines or superchargers), rear spoilers generating downforce at speed, and front splitters managing airflow under vehicles. Wide fender flares accommodate massive wheel/tire combinations (19-20 inch wheels). Signature styling cues include quad exhaust outlets (often 4+ inches diameter), aggressive front fascias with large grilles, and distinctive LED lighting. Heritage color options (Plum Crazy Purple, Grabber Blue, Competition Orange) connect to historic muscle car eras. Interiors blend retro inspiration with modern technology—deeply bolstered sport seats, flat-bottom steering wheels, large touchscreens (8-12 inches), and available premium audio systems (12+ speakers).</p>
