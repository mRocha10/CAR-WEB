                        <p class="info-text">Muscle cars represent the zenith of American automotive power and performance heritage, engineered for exhilarating acceleration and commanding road presence. These iconic vehicles typically feature large-displacement V8 engines, often exceeding 5.0 liters and producing 400-700+ horsepower and substantial torque figures (400-650 lb-ft). Characterized by rear-wheel-drive platforms and aggressive styling cues, muscle cars deliver impressive straight-line performance, with 0-60 mph times often ranging from 3.5 to 5 seconds and quarter-mile times in the 11-13 second range. Modern iterations blend classic muscle car ethos with advanced technology, incorporating sophisticated suspension systems, high-performance braking components, and driver-selectable modes that tailor performance characteristics.</p>

                        <h3 class="info-title">Distinctive Features</h3>
                        <p class="info-text">The heart of a muscle car is its powerful engine, typically a naturally aspirated or supercharged V8 featuring technologies like overhead valves (OHV), variable valve timing, and direct injection to maximize power output and efficiency. These engines are often paired with robust transmissions, either 6-speed manuals with short-throw shifters or advanced 8-10 speed automatics with paddle shifters and launch control systems. Rear-wheel drive is standard, often complemented by limited-slip differentials (LSDs) or electronic locking differentials to optimize traction during acceleration. High-performance braking systems, featuring large ventilated discs (often 14-15 inches in diameter) with multi-piston calipers (4- or 6-piston), provide necessary stopping power.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Suspension systems are tuned for performance, often featuring independent rear suspension (IRS) in modern examples, adaptive dampers (like Magnetic Ride Control), and performance-oriented spring rates and anti-roll bars. Selectable drive modes allow drivers to adjust parameters like throttle response, steering weight, suspension stiffness, transmission shift logic, and exhaust sound level. Aggressive exterior styling includes features like hood scoops, rear spoilers, wide fenders accommodating large wheels (often 19-20 inches) with wide performance tires (e.g., 275mm front, 305mm rear), and distinctive exhaust outlets. Interiors often blend retro design cues with modern technology, including performance gauges, sport seats with heavy bolstering, and infotainment systems with performance data logging capabilities.</p>

                        <p class="info-text">The muscle car segment includes several variations. Traditional muscle cars (e.g., Ford Mustang GT, Dodge Challenger R/T) offer a balance of V8 power (typically 400-480 hp), classic styling, and relative affordability. High-performance variants (e.g., Ford Mustang Shelby GT500, Dodge Challenger SRT Hellcat, Chevrolet Camaro ZL1) push the limits with supercharged V8 engines producing 650-800+ horsepower, track-focused suspension and aerodynamic upgrades, carbon-ceramic brake options, and advanced cooling systems, delivering supercar-level acceleration (0-60 mph under 3.5 seconds).</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Some models offer more accessible performance with turbocharged 4-cylinder or V6 engines (producing 275-335 hp), providing a muscle car look and feel with improved fuel efficiency and lower entry prices. Modern interpretations sometimes blend muscle car power with more sophisticated handling and luxury features, blurring the lines with grand touring coupes. Limited-edition models often feature unique styling, enhanced performance components, and collectible status, celebrating specific heritage milestones or performance achievements.</p>

                        <p class="info-text">Muscle cars appeal to driving enthusiasts who value raw power, evocative engine sounds, and aggressive styling. They are often associated with American automotive culture, cruising, and drag racing heritage. While not always the most practical choice due to typically limited rear-seat space and potentially firm rides, they offer an exhilarating driving experience and strong road presence. They serve as weekend toys, show cars, or even daily drivers for those willing to trade some comfort and efficiency for performance thrills.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Modern muscle cars integrate contemporary technology, including advanced infotainment systems, driver-assistance features (though sometimes less comprehensive than in mainstream vehicles), and connectivity options. The ability to customize performance settings through drive modes allows for greater versatility, making them more manageable in everyday driving conditions while retaining their high-performance potential. Ownership often involves participation in car clubs, shows, and track events, fostering a strong sense of community among enthusiasts who appreciate the unique blend of power, style, and heritage these vehicles offer.</p>
