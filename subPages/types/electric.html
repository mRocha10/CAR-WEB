                        <h3 class="info-title">Distinctive Features</h3>
                        <p class="info-text">EVs are distinguished by their revolutionary powertrain technology, featuring high-output electric motors that deliver instant torque for exceptional acceleration. Advanced motor configurations, including dual and tri-motor setups, provide precise torque vectoring and all-wheel-drive capabilities. The sophisticated power electronics systems manage energy flow with millisecond precision, while state-of-the-art thermal management systems ensure optimal battery performance across diverse climate conditions. The absence of internal combustion components results in near-silent operation and virtually zero vibration, creating an unprecedented level of refinement.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Modern EVs incorporate cutting-edge features such as intelligent regenerative braking systems with adaptive recuperation levels, advanced battery management systems monitoring thousands of cells in real-time, and ultra-fast charging capabilities supporting rates up to 350kW. Vehicle-to-grid (V2G) technology enables bidirectional power flow, allowing EVs to serve as mobile power sources. Smart connectivity features include predictive range calculation using real-time traffic and weather data, automated charging scheduling, and over-the-air updates that continuously enhance vehicle functionality. The simplified drivetrain architecture enables innovative design approaches, resulting in spacious interiors with flat floors and creative storage solutions.</p>
