                        <h3 class="info-title">Distinctive Features</h3>
                        <p class="info-text">EVs are characterized by their instant torque delivery, providing immediate acceleration and smooth power delivery. The absence of a traditional engine results in nearly silent operation and minimal vibration, creating an exceptionally refined driving experience. Advanced regenerative braking systems help recover energy during deceleration, extending range and improving efficiency.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Modern EVs feature sophisticated battery management systems, smart charging capabilities, and extensive connectivity options. Many models offer over-the-air updates, allowing for continuous improvement of vehicle performance and features. The simplified drivetrain architecture also results in more interior space and creative design possibilities.</p>
