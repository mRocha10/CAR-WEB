                        <h3 class="info-title">Distinctive Features</h3>
                        <p class="info-text">EVs are characterized by their electric propulsion systems, comprising one or more AC synchronous or induction motors powered by large battery packs integrated into the vehicle's floor structure, lowering the center of gravity and improving handling dynamics (lateral G-forces often exceed 0.9g). Charging capabilities include Level 1 (120V AC, ~3-5 miles of range per hour), Level 2 (240V AC, ~20-60 miles per hour), and DC Fast Charging (400-800V DC, capable of adding 100-200 miles of range in 20-30 minutes). Thermal management systems actively heat or cool the battery pack to maintain optimal operating temperatures (typically 20-40Â°C), maximizing performance and longevity.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Regenerative braking is a key feature, allowing the electric motor to act as a generator during deceleration, recuperating energy and reducing wear on conventional friction brakes. Many EVs offer 'one-pedal driving' modes where lifting off the accelerator pedal initiates significant regenerative braking, allowing the driver to control speed primarily with one pedal. Interiors often feature minimalist designs with large central touchscreens controlling most vehicle functions, enabled by the simplified powertrain packaging. Over-the-air (OTA) software updates allow manufacturers to improve performance, add features, and fix bugs remotely. Due to the absence of an engine, EVs offer exceptionally quiet operation and often feature additional front trunk ('frunk') storage space.</p>

                        <p class="info-text">EVs integrate seamlessly into modern lifestyles, particularly for users with predictable daily commutes and access to home or workplace charging. Level 2 home charging allows most owners to start each day with a full battery, effectively eliminating the need for gas station visits for routine driving. The growing public charging infrastructure, including extensive DC fast charging networks along major highways, facilitates long-distance travel, often planned using integrated navigation systems that route via charging stations and estimate charging times.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">The quiet and smooth driving experience reduces driver fatigue, while instant torque provides responsive acceleration ideal for urban driving and highway merging. Lower running costs due to cheaper electricity compared to gasoline and reduced maintenance requirements (no oil changes, fewer moving parts) contribute to lower total cost of ownership. Smart features like remote climate pre-conditioning allow owners to heat or cool the cabin before driving, enhancing comfort. Government incentives and tax credits can further reduce the purchase price, making EVs increasingly competitive with traditional gasoline vehicles. The environmental benefit of zero tailpipe emissions appeals to eco-conscious consumers.</p>
