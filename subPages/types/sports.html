                        <h3 class="info-title">Distinctive Features</h3>
                        <p class="info-text">Sports cars are characterized by their low-slung profiles and sophisticated aerodynamic designs, meticulously optimized for maximum performance and stability at high speeds. Advanced aerodynamic features include active rear wings, underbody diffusers, and precisely engineered air intakes that work in harmony to generate downforce and minimize drag. The cockpit-style interiors are driver-focused, featuring racing-inspired elements like carbon fiber trim, alcantara upholstery, and ergonomically positioned controls that enhance the connection between driver and machine.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">High-performance powertrains typically feature precision-engineered engines with advanced technologies such as direct injection, variable valve timing, and twin-scroll turbochargers, capable of producing extraordinary power outputs exceeding 500 horsepower. Sophisticated suspension systems incorporating adaptive magnetic dampers, double-wishbone architectures, and active anti-roll systems deliver exceptional handling precision. Advanced drivetrain technologies include dual-clutch transmissions with lightning-fast shift times, torque vectoring differentials, and advanced traction management systems that optimize power delivery in various driving conditions. State-of-the-art features like launch control, adjustable drive modes, and active aerodynamics work together to maximize performance potential.</p>

                        <h3 class="info-title">Sports Car Categories</h3>
                        <p class="info-text">The sports car segment encompasses various categories, each offering unique characteristics. Grand tourers (GT) blend high performance with luxury amenities, featuring powerful engines producing over 600 horsepower, sophisticated adaptive suspension systems, and premium interiors with advanced comfort features ideal for long-distance driving. Pure sports cars prioritize lightweight construction through extensive use of carbon fiber and aluminum, typically weighing less than 3,000 pounds, with track-optimized aerodynamics and razor-sharp handling dynamics for maximum driving engagement.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Track-focused variants represent the most extreme expression of performance, featuring stripped-down interiors, carbon ceramic brakes, race-derived suspension components, and aerodynamic packages generating significant downforce for maximum track capability. Modern hybrid sports cars integrate advanced electrification technology, combining traditional internal combustion engines with electric motors to produce combined outputs exceeding 1,000 horsepower while offering zero-emission driving capability.</p>
                        <p class="info-text">Supercars and hypercars represent the ultimate expression of automotive performance and technology, featuring exotic materials, advanced active aerodynamics, and cutting-edge powertrain technologies that push the boundaries of what's possible in a road-legal vehicle. These vehicles often incorporate Formula 1-derived technologies, advanced composite structures, and state-of-the-art active suspension systems capable of adjusting ride height and damping characteristics in milliseconds.</p>
